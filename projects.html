<h2>My Projects!</h2>
<p>Some of the projects that I'm most proud of are my projects I have made in Scratch. Scratch is a programming language engine, made to teach children how to program. You can create interactive stories, animations, or games! My enjoyment comes from pushing the engine to it's limit and making more complex games. Eventually, I would like to learn a real engine too.</p>
<p>That being said, here's a few projects I have made.</p>
<h3>Name Thing</h3>
<p>"Name Thing" is a game where you control a tank and fight the letters of my name, Lily! Each one has a unique fighting style, so be ready for anything.</p>

<h3>The Epic Custard</h3>
<p>When the epic custard is stolen, the world is put in danger. The Epic Custard is a quirky little story about some weirdo trying to get back a magical custard so that the world is saved! It has a fast paced bullet hell boss fight in the middle, synced to music!</p>

<h3>Just A Pong Game</h3>
<p>Unlike the name blatantly implies, Just A Pong Game is a pong game that appears normal at first but introduces a monster you have to defeat. It is an interesting spin on Scratch pong games!</p>

<p><em>Now these are fun and all, but I have a much larger scale project planned. It is a fully functional RPG engine built within Scratch that I have been working on for quite a while now. It features some original characters I made and is more polished than anything I've made before. Introducing...</em></p>
<h3>Witch Hunt</h3>
<p>This project is unfinished, but it has had significant progress done on it overtime. Here are a couple screenshots showing it in action.</p>
